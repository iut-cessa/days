Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and
identically distributed random variables with
$\operatorname{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and
$\operatorname{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\begin{equation*}
S_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
\end{equation*}
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the
random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in
distribution to a normal $N(0, \sigma^2)$.

% bonus points: the N for normal is usually set in a caligraphic
% font; you can get this using $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
